= WildFly Jakarta EE TCK Runners

This project runs the Jakarta EE TCK's. Details are listed below for the various TCK's.

== Configuration

For all TCK runners a server will be provisioned if the `JBOSS_HOME` environment variable is not set. If the environment
variable is set, that path will be used to run the TCK's.

== Running the TCK's

All TCK runners can be run individually unless explicitly stated below. To run a single TCK you can run:

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean verify -am -pl cdi-langmodel-tck,cdi-lite-tck
----

=== Jakarta EE Core Profile

To run the Jakarta EE Core Profile TCK you can use Maven with the `-Dcore.profile` system property.

[source,bash]
----
mvn clean verify -Dcore.profile
----
